# V2C Cloud Integration for Home Assistant

# This is a clone of [another repository](https://github.com/samuelebistoletti/HomeAssistant-V2C-Cloud) and is supposed to be used until the 4G issues are fixed in the original one.

This custom integration links Home Assistant with the **V2C Cloud** platform. It combines the public cloud API with the wallbox local HTTP interface so that real-time data and frequent controls use the LAN endpoint while configuration tasks still rely on the official cloud endpoints. It is purpose-built for the official V2C Cloud APIs and the local APIs exposed by **V2C Trydan** chargers.

### Companion Octopus Energy integration

If you manage smart-charging slots through Intelligent Octopus, pair this project with my [Octopus Energy Italy integration](https://github.com/samuelebistoletti/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergyIT). It exposes the Octopus APIs inside Home Assistant so that Intelligent Octopus can coordinate with V2C for advanced charging automations.

More of my Home Assistant projects live at https://samuele.bistoletti.me/.

## Key Features

- **Guided onboarding** – the config flow only asks for your API key, validates it against `/pairings/me` and stores a deterministic unique ID for re-auth flows.
- **API key management** – the API key can be updated at any time via the **Reconfigure** button in the integration panel, without removing and re-adding the integration.
- **Cloud + LAN hybrid** – the integration polls `http://<device_ip>/RealTimeData` every 30 seconds for telemetry and rapid feedback, while the cloud API handles pairing discovery, advanced settings and statistics.
- **Local-first entities** – switches, selects and numbers that have a LAN keyword reuse the per-device realtime coordinator, so the UI reflects changes right after each LAN poll without waiting for the slower cloud refresh.
- **Optimistic smoothing** – cloud-only selects and numbers hold their requested value for ~20 s, eliminating UI “flapping” between command execution and the next poll.
- **Adaptive cloud budget** – the cloud coordinator automatically scales its interval with `ceil(devices * 86400 / 850)` seconds (never below 90 s) to respect the 1000 calls/day quota while leaving headroom for manual services.
- **Resilient polling** – cloud fetches revert to the default cadence immediately after connectivity issues, while LAN realtime requests retry with backoff and schedule follow-up refreshes after failed writes so entities recover automatically when Wi-Fi returns.
- **Comprehensive services** – Wi-Fi provisioning, timers, RFID lifecycle, photovoltaic profiles v2, scheduled charging helpers, OCPP/inverter settings and statistics exports, all implemented as Home Assistant services.
- **Automation-ready events** – data retrieval services (`scan_wifi_networks`, statistics, power profiles) emit events that contain the raw payload so automations can capture and store results.
- **Diagnostics aware** – the latest `RateLimit-*` headers are persisted in coordinator data and logs specify whether the LAN or cloud path was used, simplifying troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- A V2C Cloud account with at least one wallbox paired and an API key generated from [https://v2c.cloud/home/user](https://v2c.cloud/home/user).
- The wallbox must be reachable on the local network (open the HTTP port used by `/RealTimeData` and `/write/...`). Ideally reserve a static IP or DHCP lease so the integration can keep using LAN features; the integration will fall back to the last reported IP or the pairing metadata when static data is missing.
- Home Assistant 2023.12 or newer.
- Internet access towards `https://v2c.cloud/kong/v2c_service` for cloud calls.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Add this repository to HACS as a *Custom repository* (category **Integration**).
2. Search for **V2C Cloud** and install the integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant when prompted.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**, choose **V2C Cloud** and enter your API key.

### Manual installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/v2c_cloud` folder into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant instance.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the **V2C Cloud** integration from **Settings → Devices & Services**.

## Configuration

### Get your API key
1. Sign in to [https://v2c.cloud/home/user](https://v2c.cloud/home/user) with the account that owns the chargers.
2. Open the **User → API** panel (left navigation shown in the screenshot above).
3. Click **Get token** to generate the developer token, then copy the value shown in the field.
4. Store the token somewhere safe: it is the only secret you need for Home Assistant and it grants full access to your account.

### Complete the setup
1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and pick **V2C Cloud**.
2. Paste the API token when prompted; the integration always talks to the official V2C endpoint (`https://v2c.cloud/kong/v2c_service`), so no other options are required.
3. Every pairing returned by `/pairings/me` is turned into a Home Assistant device with sensors, numbers, switches and services ready to use. Polling intervals, LAN/Cloud fallbacks and cached data are handled automatically after onboarding.

### Change your API key
If you need to rotate or replace the API key after the initial setup, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → V2C Cloud** and click **Reconfigure**. Enter the new key, and the integration will validate it and reload automatically. No entities or device history are lost.

## Development & Testing

### Running the test suite

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The suite (350 tests) runs entirely without a live Home Assistant instance or a real charger. It covers:

- **HTTP client** – cloud API calls, authentication, retry and rate-limit handling, pairings cache
- **Device state gathering** – `async_gather_devices_state`, per-device fetch parallelism, fallback to previous data on transient errors
- **Entity helpers** – `coerce_bool`, device state resolution, `_OptimisticHoldMixin` (hold window, expiry, match-clears-hold)
- **Binary sensor** – `V2CConnectedBinarySensor.is_on` for all truthy/falsy types plus `reported` fallback
- **Sensors** – conversion helpers (`_as_float`, `_as_int`, `_as_str`, `_as_flag`), `_localize_state` (all keys, multi-language), `V2CLocalRealtimeSensor.native_value`
- **Switches** – `V2CBooleanSwitch` state resolution (local / reported / optimistic), availability, icon sync
- **Numbers** – `V2CNumberEntity` native value (local vs reported), optimistic hold, `_values_match` tolerance, availability
- **Selects** – `V2CEnumSelect` value resolution, `current_option`, optimistic hold, localised options
- **Buttons** – `V2CButton.async_press` success, no-refresh mode, `V2CError` / `V2CLocalApiError` → `HomeAssistantError`
- **Config flow** – `_probe_local_api` SSRF guard, valid/invalid IPs, HTTP error and malformed JSON handling
- **Local API** – SSRF guard in `async_write_keyword` and `_async_fetch_local_data`, boundary address parametrisation

### CI / CD

Every push and pull request to `main` runs:

| Workflow | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| **Tests** | `pytest` suite |
| **Security** | Bandit SAST · pip-audit dependency audit · gitleaks secret scan |
| **CodeQL** | GitHub CodeQL static analysis for Python and Actions |
| **HACS** | HACS integration validation |
| **hassfest** | Home Assistant manifest validation |

The **Tag and Release** workflow only creates a tag and GitHub release after both the Tests and Security jobs pass.
